## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A Locust HTML report file

### Installation
No installation required! This is a client-side web application.

1. **Download the files**:
   - `index.html` - Main application file
   - `app.js` - JavaScript logic
   - `README.md` - This documentation

2. **Open the application**:
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or serve it using a local web server (recommended for best performance)

### Using a Local Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

   - Processing typically takes 1-2 seconds

### 2. **Explore the Dashboard**
   The application organizes data into four main tabs:

   **📈 Overview Tab**
   - Request success/failure comparison
   - Response time analysis (min, max, average)

   **⚡ Performance Tab**
   - Response time percentiles
   - Throughput (RPS) distribution

   **❌ Errors Tab**
   - Error distribution pie chart
   - Detailed error table with messages

   **📋 Details Tab**
   - Complete statistics table
   - All metrics in sortable format

### 3. **Interpret the Results**
   - **Green indicators**: Successful operations
   - **Red indicators**: Failures or errors
   - **Charts**: Interactive - hover for details
   - **Tables**: Click column headers to sort

  - Total requests and failures
  - Average, minimum, maximum response times
  - Current requests per second (RPS)
  - Request methods and endpoints

- **Response Time Analysis**:
  - Percentile distributions (50th, 95th, 99th)
  - Response time trends across endpoints

- **Error Analysis**:
  - Error types and frequencies
  - Detailed error messages
  - Failure rates by endpoint

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Throughput analysis

2. Extracts `window.templateArgs` JavaScript object
3. Parses the JSON data structure
4. Processes statistics and creates visualizations
5. Renders interactive charts and tables

## 🎯 Use Cases

Perfect for:
- **Performance Engineers**: Quick report analysis and sharing
- **DevOps Teams**: CI/CD pipeline integration
- **QA Teams**: Load testing result interpretation
- **Developers**: Performance bottleneck identification
- **Management**: High-level performance reporting

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **100% Client-Side**: No data leaves your browser
- **No Server Required**: Works completely offline
- **No Data Storage**: Files are processed in memory only
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses only CDN libraries for charts

## 🤔 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**File won't upload:**
- Ensure the file is a valid Locust HTML report
- Check file size (very large files may take longer)
- Try refreshing the page and uploading again

**Charts not displaying:**
- Ensure you have an internet connection (for Chart.js CDN)
- Check if your browser blocks JavaScript
- Try using a different browser

**Data looks incorrect:**
- Verify the Locust report was generated properly
- Check the browser console for any error messages
- Ensure the HTML file contains `window.templateArgs`

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your Locust report format
3. Try with a different report file
4. Use a modern browser version

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
